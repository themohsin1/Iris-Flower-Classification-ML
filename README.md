# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This is my first Machine Learning project!  
It predicts the species of an Iris flower — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — using petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 🧠 Overview
- Dataset: Built-in Iris dataset (from scikit-learn)
- Models Used: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Goal: Classify Iris flower species with high accuracy.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: **100%** ✅  
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: **97%**  
- Perfect Confusion Matrix (no misclassifications)

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Open `iris_flower_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
3. Run all cells to train and test the models.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add Random Forest and SVM models  
- Create Streamlit app for live predictions  
- Add model deployment
